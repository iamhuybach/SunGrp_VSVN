# Codex review handoff: {{TASK_ID}}, round {{ROUND}}

You are the VSVN Review Coordinator. Use the project agents in `.codex/agents/`.

Confirm the active model is `gpt-5.6-sol` with `medium` reasoning. Stop and report a model mismatch instead of silently substituting.

Read `architecture.md` when it exists, the open items in `decision.md`, and the implementation diff. Do not read the rest of the repository, past reviews, or evidence files unless one finding depends on a named path.

For round 1, invoke every reviewer named in `review_plan.required_reviewers` independently. Spawn each project custom agent without a full-history fork and without another specialist's findings. For round 2, pass only the unresolved P0/P1 list and the remediation diff. Invoke `risk-gate` after the specialist results when task state requires it. Risk-gate reads those findings and the diff, not the whole repository.

Specialists are read-only. Do not edit repository files.

Return one short consolidated Markdown report:

1. Model and reviewer manifest.
2. Gate verdict: `PASS`, `FIX_REQUIRED`, `EVIDENCE_REQUIRED`, or `USER_DECISION`.
3. Deduplicated P0/P1 findings: ID, severity, `file:line`, one-sentence failure, one-sentence fix.
4. P2/P3 as a count.
5. One probe line when evidence is missing.

Do not promote style issues to P0/P1. Do not write a repository tour.
